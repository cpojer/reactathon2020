        "question": "What is Reactathon?",
        "answer": "Reactathon is a conference for engineers, managers, and technology leaders who use and love React. It’s a way to bring the community together to share ideas, make new connections, and get inspired. These are our three goals:",
        "bullets": {
          "bulletOne": "Education. We’ve hand-selected a number of talks that are highly relevant to your everyday work, and pushing the boundaries of frontend development.",
          "bulletTwo": "Connections. We facilitate connections through themes, topics, and activities that make it easier to connect with others; from introverts to social butterflies, and everyone in between. Now is more important than ever to give yourself a boost of morale by meeting with colleagues in-person.",
          "bulletThree": "Inspiration. There’s nothing quite like being in-person for an event where you not only learn from leaders in your field who take the stage, but also connect with them, and many others, in the hallway track and through activities. The discussion and excitement generated from these in-person connections, and the liberal exchange of knowledge, will leave you truly energized and inspired to take your own code and company to the next level. Not to mention, you’re likely to strengthen bonds with your existing connections, and perhaps make new friends for life."

        "answerFour": "Lastly, check out the #SCHEDULE#. We’ve taken great care to curate a lineup of talks that are varied, practical, relevant, and boundary-pushing. Each of these talks will give you something to take back to the office to improve your company’s code.",

        "question": "What Covid safety measures are in place?",
        "answer": "All workshop attendees must show proof of full vaccination plus negative test result within 48 hours of admission (PCR or Antigen), in addition to a temperature check.

        "question": "How does the conference help to facilitate connections between attendees?",
        "answer": "There's more to conferences than just the talks -- meeting new people and discussing in the 'Hallway Track' are a vital part of an event! However, we've noticed that it can be difficult to start new conversations and meet new people. This is why we take many steps to facilitate discussion:",
        "bullets": {
          "bulletOne": "Topic Tables. This event takes place on Day 1, folloiwng the opening keynote and lightning talks. It is designed to help you easily discover the topics that you care about and are interested in, and more easily engage in conversation with others, or simply listen to others discuss. The topics are managed by industry leaders -- maintainers and core-contributors of popular libraries and projects in the extended React ecosystem -- but you're encouraged to chat with other attendees in the area who are also interested in that topic! Topic Tables are a great way to engage in conversation and meet some new friends -- which will  make the rest of your conference experience better! And who knows, you could make a new friend for life.",
          "bulletTwo": "The Pac-Man Rule. This simple rule encourages group conversations to always keep an opening in their circle of discussion. That way, passers-by are encouraged to join in the conversation!",
          "bulletThree": "Badge questions. We ask two questions at checkout that will appear on your badge: 'What's one thing you're passionate about', and 'What's one thing you want to learn'. This helps to break the ice and start conversations between two people who've never met before!",
          "bulletFour": "Breaks. We have frequent breaks and an extended lunch period that allow you to reflect on the talks, discuss with and connect with other attendees, and make new friends!",
          "bulletFive": "Unconference ice-breakers. The past two years have been tough for everyone. We've each responded and dealt with various struggles in different ways. Before the gates open for general admission, we are facilitating 2 hours of discussions and talks to discuss the human side of the last two years.",
          "bulletSix": "Activities. We will have various activities during breaks for you to connect with others who are also interested in those activities. Additionally, we provide you with an attendee guide and map to see all the top restaurants, bars, parks, and hiking areas in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, and in San Francisco!",
          "bulletSeven": "Sponsors. All of our sponsors are using React in production, and many this year are also Cloud/Serverless providers building exciting tech that turn frontend developers into fullstack superheroes. We encourage you to chat with them about how they're using React, how their API or service works, and see if you can learn something from each other!",

        "question": "How do you promote inclusion and accessibility at this conference?",
        "answer": "Conferences are not always accessible to folks who are not full-time employed. They are often very expensive to operate and manage, especially in the SF Bay Area -- one of the most expensive areas in the world. Also being an outdoor event, our A/V costs are enormous due to the required LED screen, which are orders of magnitude more expensive than projectors. As such, the per-person cost of this event is extremeley high, and we are limited in many respects by fundamental financial limitations. The organizer of this conference is an independent organizer -- and this event has no official corporate backing apart from our sponsors. That said, we take a number of steps to ensure that we are providing a conference that is accessible to those who cannot afford it and/or are underrepresented in the tech community, with a specific focus on intersectionality. We offer diversity scholarships to provide a number of folks with free or heavily-discounted admission to the event. A limited number of students can receive a heavy discount with proof of current enrollment. Individuals and companies also have the opportunity to sponsor one or more individuals by paying for their admission to the conference -- simply by purchasing a 'Diversity/Scholarshop' ticket on the tito registration page. Lastly, we encourage and promote an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere at the event, which are clearly communicated on our Code of Conduct and also the 'Amenities' section of this FAQ page., and reinforced by the MC and other official communications."

        "answer": "Yes, we will provide beer & wine during the onsite afterparty on Wednesday, May 4. We are considering providing beer & wine during the welcome reception following the keynotes. All consumption of alcohol requires age verification with a government-issued photo ID. The offsite afterparty on May 5 will also provide beer & wine (if we confirm sponsorship) or will be a cash bar (if we do not secure sponsorship)."

        "answer": "Inform the registration team at check-in that you do not want to be photographed. We have lanyards that will identify you as someone who wishes to not appear in videography and photography. Our photographers and videographers will do their best to ensure that you do not appear in any photos. That said, we are documenting this event with both photography and videography, and you may still appear in photos and videos, especially in the background. We will do our best to ensure you are not featured as the main subject in photos and videos but cannot guarantee it. Also, note that removing your no-photo lanyard is consent to appear in photos or videos. If you want to be 100% certain that you won't appear in videos/photographs, we advise you to watch the talks from the comfort of your own home via the videos to be released after the event."

        "answer": "We believe that COVID-19 has become endemic and is not a short-term phenomenon that can be eradicated with time or collecive isolation. Animal reservoirs & our need to continue our economy and day-to-day life make this impossible. Until and unless a miracle occurs, new variants will continue to emerge. Given this new reality, and to provide a pathway forward, the following safety measures will be employed and enforced to the strictest possible extent, which we believe will lower the possibility of transmission as close to 0 as humanly possible:",
        "bullets": {
          "bulletOne": "Anyone present on-site including attendees, sponsors, speakers, vendors, staff, and volunteers, are required to prove full vaccination, and provide a negative test result within 48 hours (for PCR) or 24 hours (for Antigen) of admission, and submit to a daily health screening with temperature check. Full vaccination is defined as 2 or more doses of the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine, or 1 or more of the J&J vaccine. Antigen and rapid RT-PCR tests will be available on-site for those who do not meet the testing requirement (paid for by the attendee -- receipt given for insurance/company reimbursement; those with Kaiser insurance can have insurance billed directly).",

        }
      },
      {
        "answer": "Given these points above, we are providing a pathway forward to return to some form of normalcy. The past two years have been incredibly difficult on the mental health of many people. The extended isolation has created a parallel pandemic of depression, hopelessness, and anxiety. Humans are social beings and we need face-to-face interaction to look forward to and experience. With the above safety measures in place, we believe that this event will provide much needed respite, hope, and inspiration that only true in-person interactions and connections can provide."

        "answer": "If you cannot take the vaccine due to a medical issue, an exemption can be made with proof of a doctor's note. You will still be required to submit proof of negative test result within 48 hours (for PCR) or 24 hours (for Antigen) of admission, and submit to daily temperature checks."

      {
        "question": "What are the policies around the temperature checks?",
        "answer": "The CDC defines a fever as 100.4 degrees fahrenheit. If your temperature is at this level or above from the laser temp reader, you have the option of taking a mouth temperature test for a more accurate reading. If your temperature still shows to be 100.4 or higher, you will be unable to attend for the duration of the event and will be advised to return home or to your hotel and isolate. If your temperature is elevated on the first day, you will be refunded the price of your ticket, less processing fees. If it is elevated on subsequent days, you will be refunded 50% of your ticket, less processing fees."

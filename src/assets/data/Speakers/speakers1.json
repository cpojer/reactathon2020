        "talkAbstract": "Application State Management is one of the hardest parts of building and maintaining React Applications. The number of options you have is numerous and the reason is that it's just such a hard problem with so many nuances and trade-offs. One thing that makes application state management harder is when we aren't thoughtful about how that state is organized and categorized in our app. There are different kinds of state and they require different approaches for management. When you try to treat all app state exactly the same is when problems come into play. Let's talk about what some of those categories are and how we can drastically simplify our application code and improve our app's performance by thinking about and organizing our state differently.",

        "talkAbstract": "TypeScript is often praised for adding a layer of bug protection on top of JavaScript applications. But, how can we also use TypeScript to improve the readability of our React component interfaces for our fellow team members? Just because types compile, doesnâ€™t mean they are helping to document and describe our code for our future selves and others. Perhaps we can shift our perspective about TypeScript from a bug catching tool to a developer experience tool that enables us to write reasonable and intuitive code interfaces. In this talk, you will learn how to think like a consumer and take advantage of basic and advanced TypeScript types to enhance the readability of your React component APIs.",

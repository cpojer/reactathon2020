Culture and system.\n\nAt work they keep giving you stupid little problems with no growth. You crave challenge and keep tweaking CSS instead. You want some responsibility, damn it! What's that coworker got that you don't?\n\nMost of all you crave autonomy. The freedom to tackle big challenges and help the company with your brilliance. They don't even see all the bad code you see! How can they live like this??\n\nInstead of autonomy, you're getting babysat. Managers asking what you're up to, daily standups that feel like a drag, pushback and 'maybe someday' on every idea that you give.\n\nI was like that a few years ago. A totally senior engineer who keeps running into walls and getting stuck. Now even bigger companies trust me with designing systems and leading teams on projects that could make or break the company.\n\nIn this workshop you'll learn what changed and how to apply the Senior Mindset to your work and career:",

And that's only if you bother to deal with the problems.\n\nTired of wiring up onSubmit to backend APIs and making sure your client-side cache stays up-to-date? Wouldn't it be cool to be able to use the global nature of CSS to your benefit, rather than find tools or conventions to avoid or work around it? And how would you like nested layouts with intelligent and performance optimized data management that just worksâ„¢?\n\nRemix solves some of these problems, and completely eliminates the rest. You don't even have to think about server cache management or global CSS namespace clashes. It's not that Remix has APIs to avoid these problems, they simply don't exist when you're using Remix. Oh, and you don't need that huge complex graphql client when you're using Remix. They've got you covered. Ready to build faster apps faster?",

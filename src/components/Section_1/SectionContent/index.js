        <p>At Reactathon, we faciliate conversations around the latest topics, technologies, and various skill levels to help you find the people & subjects that are most meaningful for you. Whether you are a junior engineer looking to learn from senior engineers & thought-leaders, a director of engineering seeking to push the boundaries of your own team, or just someone who loves the energy & network effect of in-person events, Reactathon has something for you.</p>
        <p>We curate a single track of talks that not only help you to learn from some of the brightest minds and best speakers in web development -- but also to facilitate more dialogue with your frontend peers. These lessons & experiences will have a direct impact not only for you and your company -- but also for your morale & overall enjoyment that will last well beyond the conference itself.</p>

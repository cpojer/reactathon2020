          At Reactathon, we facilitate conversations around the latest topics,
          technologies, and various skill levels to help you find the people &
          subjects that are most meaningful for you. You will learn from some of
          the leading engineers in the field who present on stage in a single
          track. Whether you are a junior engineer looking to learn from senior
          engineers & thought-leaders, a director of engineering seeking to push
          the boundaries of your own team, or just someone who loves the energy
          & network effect of in-person events, Reactathon has something for
          you.
